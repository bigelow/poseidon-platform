## Service Architecture Patterns

### Service Design Principles

**Single Responsibility**

- Each service owns one functional domain
- Clear boundaries between service capabilities
- Minimal coupling through well-defined APIs

**Independent Deployment**

- Services deployable without coordination
- Containerized with standardized tooling
- Version management and backward compatibility

**Operational Excellence**

- Health monitoring and observability built-in
- Graceful degradation and error handling
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Service Communication Patterns

**Synchronous Communication**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Current as poseidon-current
    participant Forge as poseidon-forge
    participant Harbor as poseidon-harbor
    
    Dev->>Current: Initiate commit workflow
    Current->>Forge: Trigger CI pipeline
    Forge->>Harbor: Deploy on success
    Harbor->>Current: Deployment status
    Current->>Dev: Workflow complete
```

**Asynchronous Communication**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Tide as poseidon-tide
    participant Oracle as poseidon-oracle
    participant Lighthouse as poseidon-lighthouse
    
    Tide->>Oracle: New data available (event)
    Oracle->>Oracle: Process and index
    Oracle->>Lighthouse: Indexing metrics (event)
    Lighthouse->>Lighthouse: Update dashboards
```
