# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document the significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Poseidon Platform. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of important technical choices.

## Decision Log

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](adr-001-microservices.md) | Microservices Architecture | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-002](adr-002-testing-strategy.md) | Test-Driven Development Strategy | Accepted | 2024-01 |
| [ADR-003](adr-003-ai-integration.md) | Local AI Integration | Accepted | 2024-02 |
| [ADR-004](adr-004-deployment-model.md) | Modular Monorepo Deployment | Accepted | 2024-02 |

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're addressing?
- **Decision**: What is the change we're proposing/doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?

## Principles

Our architectural decisions are guided by:

- **Developer Experience**: Minimize cognitive overhead and maximize productivity
- **Operational Excellence**: Design for reliability, observability, and maintainability
- **Security by Design**: Integrate security considerations from the start
- **Performance**: Sub-second feedback loops and efficient resource utilization
- **Simplicity**: Follow KISS principles and avoid unnecessary complexity
