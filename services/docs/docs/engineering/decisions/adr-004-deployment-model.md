# ADR-004: Modular Monorepo Deployment

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-02-15  
**Authors**: IC Technical Leadership  

## Context

The Poseidon Platform requires a deployment strategy that supports:

- **Independent service deployment** without coupling between services
- **Standardized tooling** across all platform components
- **Developer productivity** through consistent development experience
- **Operational simplicity** while maintaining deployment flexibility
- **Plug-and-play architecture** enabling service addition/removal

### Problem Statement

How should we structure our repository and deployment pipeline to enable independent service development while maintaining operational consistency and demonstrating modern DevOps practices?

## Decision

We will implement a **Modular Monorepo Deployment Strategy** with the following characteristics:

### Repository Structure

**Modular Monorepo Organization**:
```
poseidon/
├── services/
│   ├── current/                    # Self-contained service
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile              # Service-specific containerization
│   │   ├── compose.yml             # Local development environment
│   │   ├── Taskfile.yml            # Standardized automation
│   │   ├── requirements.txt        # Service dependencies
│   │   └── k8s/                    # Kubernetes manifests
│   ├── forge/                      # Independent CI/CD service
│   ├── harbor/                     # Independent deployment service
│   ├── lighthouse/                 # Independent monitoring service
│   ├── anchor/                     # Independent config service
│   ├── depths/                     # Independent infrastructure service
│   ├── tide/                       # Independent data service
│   ├── oracle/                     # Independent knowledge service
│   └── docs/                       # Documentation service
└── README.md                       # Root-level overview only
```

### Standardized Service Pattern

**Every Service Contains**:

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage builds with uv for performance
- **compose.yml**: Complete local development environment
- **Taskfile.yml**: Standardized automation with alphabetized tasks
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies managed by uv
- **k8s/**: Kubernetes deployment manifests

### Independent Deployment Model

**Service Autonomy**:
```yaml
# Each service's compose.yml
services:
  service-name:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "PORT:PORT"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

**Containerization Strategy**:
```dockerfile
# Standardized Dockerfile pattern
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install uv for fast dependency management
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies with uv
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -r requirements.txt

# Copy service code
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "-m", "service_module"]
```

### Task Automation Standardization

**Consistent Taskfile.yml Pattern**:
```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  build:
    cmds:
      - docker build -t poseidon/service-name:latest .
    desc: Build Docker image

  clean:
    cmds:
      - docker compose down --volumes
      - rm -rf __pycache__ .pytest_cache
    desc: Clean build artifacts

  default:
    cmds:
      - task -l

  dev:
    cmds:
      - docker compose up --build
    desc: Start development environment

  test:
    cmds:
      - pytest tests/ -v
    desc: Run test suite
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Multiple Repositories (Multi-Repo)

**Pros**:

- Complete service isolation
- Independent access control
- Separate CI/CD pipelines
- Clear ownership boundaries

**Cons**:

- Tooling inconsistency across repos
- Difficult cross-service changes
- Dependency management complexity
- Code sharing challenges
- Overhead of maintaining multiple repos

**Why Rejected**: Creates operational overhead and makes standardization difficult. Doesn't demonstrate cohesive platform thinking.

### 2. Traditional Monorepo

**Pros**:

- Single source of truth
- Easy cross-service changes
- Shared tooling and dependencies
- Simplified CI/CD

**Cons**:

- Tight coupling between services
- Single point of failure for deployments
- Large checkout and build times
- Difficult to scale team access
- No independent deployment capability

**Why Rejected**: Violates microservices principles and doesn't enable independent service development.

### 3. Microrepo with Shared Libraries

**Pros**:

- Service independence
- Shared code through libraries
- Independent deployment

**Cons**:

- Complex dependency management
- Version compatibility challenges
- Library release coordination
- Increased maintenance overhead

**Why Rejected**: Adds unnecessary complexity for the platform scale and doesn't showcase deployment expertise.

### 4. Serverless Deployment

**Pros**:

- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Reduced infrastructure management
- Pay-per-use cost model

**Cons**:

- Vendor lock-in
- Cold start latency
- Limited execution environment
- Complex local development
- Reduced control over deployment

**Why Rejected**: Doesn't demonstrate container orchestration and Kubernetes expertise expected at senior levels.

## Consequences

- **Debugging tools** for distributed service troubleshooting

**Operational Excellence**:

- **Monitoring standards** across all services
- **Logging aggregation** for centralized observability
- **Health check** patterns for service reliability
- **Deployment automation** reducing manual coordination

## Implementation Details

### Service Template Structure

**New Service Creation**:
```bash
# Service creation script
create_service() {
    SERVICE_NAME=$1
    mkdir -p services/$SERVICE_NAME/{src,tests,k8s}
    
    # Copy standardized files
    cp templates/Dockerfile services/$SERVICE_NAME/
    cp templates/compose.yml services/$SERVICE_NAME/
    cp templates/Taskfile.yml services/$SERVICE_NAME/
    cp templates/requirements.txt services/$SERVICE_NAME/
    
    # Customize for service
    sed -i "s/SERVICE_NAME/$SERVICE_NAME/g" services/$SERVICE_NAME/*
}
```

### Docker Optimization

**Multi-Stage Build Pattern**:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -r requirements.txt

# Production stage  
FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Non-root user for security
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
USER appuser

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "-m", "service_module"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

**Standardized Deployment Pattern**:
```yaml
# k8s/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: poseidon-service-name
  namespace: poseidon
  labels:
    app: poseidon-service-name
    service: service-name
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: poseidon-service-name
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: poseidon-service-name
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: service-name
        image: poseidon/service-name:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```

### Service Discovery Integration

**Health Check Standards**:
```python
# Standard health endpoints for all services
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    """Kubernetes liveness probe"""
    return {'status': 'healthy', 'timestamp': time.time()}

@app.route('/ready')  
def readiness_check():
    """Kubernetes readiness probe"""
    # Check dependencies (DB, external services, etc.)
    return {'status': 'ready', 'dependencies': check_dependencies()}

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    """Prometheus metrics endpoint"""
    return generate_prometheus_metrics()
```

### Automation Standards

**Task Alphabetization Pattern**:
```yaml
# Enforced alphabetical ordering
tasks:
  build:        # Always first build-related task
    # ...
  clean:        # Always cleanup task  
    # ...
  default:      # Always help/list task
    cmds:
      - task -l
  deploy:       # Deployment task
    # ...
  dev:          # Development environment
    # ...
  test:         # Testing task
    # ...
```
