# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Authors**: IC Technical Leadership  

## Context

The Poseidon Platform requires an architecture that supports:

- **Independent development** of different platform capabilities
- **Flexible deployment** strategies for different environments
- **Technology diversity** as requirements evolve
- **Team scalability** as the platform grows
- **Clear boundaries** between different functional domains

### Problem Statement

How should we structure the Poseidon Platform to enable rapid development, deployment flexibility, and long-term maintainability while demonstrating enterprise-grade architectural thinking?

## Decision

We will implement the Poseidon Platform as a **microservices architecture** with the following characteristics:

### Service Decomposition

**Eight specialized services** based on functional domains:

1. **poseidon-current**: Development workflow automation
2. **poseidon-forge**: CI/CD pipeline management  
3. **poseidon-harbor**: Deployment automation
4. **poseidon-lighthouse**: Monitoring and observability
5. **poseidon-anchor**: Configuration and secrets management
6. **poseidon-depths**: Infrastructure and service discovery
7. **poseidon-tide**: Data ingestion workflows
8. **poseidon-oracle**: Knowledge discovery and RAG

### Service Characteristics

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns one functional domain
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed separately
- **Technology Agnostic**: Services can use different tech stacks as appropriate
- **API-First**: Well-defined interfaces between services
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and storage

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST APIs for request-response patterns
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication for workflows
- **Service Mesh**: Secure service-to-service communication
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for external consumers

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture

**Pros**:

- Simpler initial development and deployment
- Easier debugging and testing
- No network latency between components

**Cons**:

- Single point of failure
- Difficult to scale individual components
- Technology lock-in
- Team coordination bottlenecks
- Deployment coupling

**Why Rejected**: Doesn't demonstrate modern architectural patterns or scalability thinking required for enterprise systems.

### 2. Modular Monolith

**Pros**:

- Clear module boundaries
- Simpler deployment than microservices
- Easier refactoring than full monolith

**Cons**:

- Still technology lock-in
- Shared deployment pipeline
- Limited scaling flexibility
- Doesn't showcase distributed systems expertise

**Why Rejected**: While reasonable for some contexts, doesn't demonstrate the distributed systems knowledge expected at senior IC levels.

### 3. Serverless Functions

**Pros**:

- Auto-scaling and cost efficiency
- No infrastructure management
- Event-driven by nature

**Cons**:

- Vendor lock-in
- Cold start latency
- Limited execution time
- Complex state management
- Debugging challenges

**Why Rejected**: Doesn't provide sufficient control for demonstrating infrastructure and architectural expertise.

## Consequences

### Positive

**Development Velocity**

- Teams can work independently on different services
- Technology choices optimized for each domain
- Faster iteration cycles through independent deployments

**Operational Benefits**

- Isolated failure domains
- Independent scaling of bottleneck components
- Easier A/B testing and feature rollouts
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries

**Technical Excellence**

- Demonstrates modern distributed systems knowledge
- Showcases API design and service integration skills
- Forces good practices around error handling and resilience

**Portfolio Value**

- Shows enterprise-scale architectural thinking
- Demonstrates understanding of Conway's Law
- Exhibits knowledge of modern deployment strategies

### Negative

**Operational Complexity**

- Service discovery and configuration management required
- Network communication introduces latency and failure modes
- Distributed debugging and monitoring challenges
- Transaction management across service boundaries

**Development Overhead**

- API versioning and compatibility management
- Integration testing complexity
- Service coordination for cross-cutting features
- Infrastructure setup and maintenance

**Learning Curve**

- Team needs distributed systems expertise
- Operational tooling requires additional learning
- Debugging skills must adapt to distributed context

### Mitigation Strategies

**Service Discovery**: Implement **poseidon-depths** with Consul for robust service discovery

**Configuration Management**: Use **poseidon-anchor** with Vault for centralized, secure configuration

**Observability**: Build **poseidon-lighthouse** for comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing

**Development Tooling**: Standardize development experience with Docker, task automation, and local testing

**API Design**: Implement API versioning, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Design Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Service boundaries align with business capabilities
2. **API-First**: Design APIs before implementation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing API contracts
4. **Idempotency**: All operations should be safely retryable
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast and gracefully handle downstream failures

### Deployment Strategy

- **Containerization**: All services packaged as Docker containers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kubernetes manifests for all deployments
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new versions

### Monitoring Requirements

- **Health Checks**: Each service must expose health endpoints
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics for all services
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across service boundaries
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format across all services

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity**: 50% reduction in feature delivery time
- **Deployment Frequency**: Daily deployments without coordination overhead
- **Service Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for individual services
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: <5 minutes for service-level issues
