# Services Overview

The Poseidon Platform consists of seven specialized microservices, each designed with specific responsibilities and clear boundaries.

## Service Architecture

The platform follows a modular monorepo pattern where each service is:

- **Completely independent**: No runtime dependencies between services
- **Plug-and-play**: Services can be added, removed, or replaced without affecting others
- **Standardized tooling**: Consistent development and deployment patterns
- **Self-contained**: Each service includes all necessary configuration and dependencies
